# Dimlit

In Dimlit, a rogue finds herself in a dark field, with a single dwindling light source. The rogue must use resources found around the field to power the light source and construct other structures to help her kill the creature lurking in the dark before it's too late.

# Spaces

The game's only space is a 2D field of darkness, where areas can be lit up by structures.

# Goals

The goal of the game is to kill the creature lurking in the dark.

# Components

## The Rogue

The rogue is pretty simple and only has two stats: **health** and **crystals** of varying color.

**Health** is static, and only regenerates under within certain towers. Most hits from the creature can outright kill the rogue.

**Crystals** are found throughout the map and are used to construct and power structures. They can also be used by the rogue to perform actions.

## Crystals

**White Crystals**: The most common crystal. Used to illuminate.

**Red Crystals**: Can be used for offensive structures and scaring the creature.

**Green Crystals**: Can be used for regeneration and empowering structures.

**Blue Crystals**: Can be used for defensive structures.

**Yellow Crystals**: Can be used for gathering information and scanning.

**Purple Crystals**: Can be used for effecting the creature's energy and possibly putting it to sleep.

**Cyan Crystals**: Can be used for luring the creature to a location.

**Black Crystals**: Really rare, cannot be detected. Used for traps and light explosions. The creature can't detect these.

## Crystalline Structures

Structures can consume crystals and be constructed from them. Each one does something different to help the rogue against the creature.

**White Crystalline Structure**: Created from white crystals, this produces light in an area. The number of crystals stored determines the lights strength and area following the inverse-square law.

## The Creature

The creature is enormously powerful. Going to head to head will likely end in instant death. The creature does have a few weaknesses, however. For one, the creature cannot stand light, in fact, a little light can stun it, and enough light can outright kill it. Secondly, the creature has to eat, and can starve to death after a certain amount of time.
